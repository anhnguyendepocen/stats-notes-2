# Preface {-}

This is a collection of notes on statistics and data analytics that I am compiling, primarily to supplement a course that I teach at the National University of Singapore (BT1101: Introduction to Business Analytics), which is a statistics course in R targeted at first-year undergraduate students and aspiring data scientists / researchers. 


I hope to cover quite broadly several important and broadly useful statistical concepts (e.g. regression, simulations), as well as discuss issues like data visualization best practices. If I have time, I would like to transition to teaching statistics in a more Bayesian tradition.


As some background, I am trained as a cognitive psychologist, with a little bit of training in econometrics, so I tend to favor regression and simulation approaches, and my examples may default to examples common in the social sciences.


This is a work in progress that is inspired by Russ Poldrack's Psych10 book here: http://statsthinking21.org/.
