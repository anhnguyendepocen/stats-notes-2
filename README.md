# Statistics Notes

This is a working collection of statistics notes that I am compiling, in particular to supplement my course *BT1101: Introduction to Business Analytics*, at the National University of Singapore. Note, I don't teach the course every semester, and the syllabus is always evolving.

Topics that I would like to eventually cover with this set of notes include:

- Descriptive Statistics
- Regression Analysis (including multiple regression and interactions)
- Time Series Analysis
- Introduction to Data Mining techniques
- Monte carlo simulations
- Simple linear optimization / with integer constraints.
- Data Visualization
- Data Munging
- Good (R & R Markdown) Practices
